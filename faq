          <p>
            Started in 2015, RipplePop is a one-stop-shop for any and all WordPress help.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            RipplePop gives you and your company a professional and dedicated developer for a flat weekly fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            A RipplePop developer works in your tools (Slack, Basecamp, Asana, anything!) and on your timezone, no
            matter where your businesses or customers are in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can scale your development team up and down as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Best of all, with RipplePop you get the reliability and accountability of the RipplePop support team in
            Chicago.&nbsp;

          <p>
            We try to make the process of getting the best developer to help you as simple as possible. The first step is to <a href="https://calendly.com/ripplepop/call" target="_blank" class="text-sky-500">get on a call with us</a> so we can learn more about your needs and make sure we are a good fit. Then we will work to find the best developer on our team for your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we find that developer you can speak with them directly before signing up if you wish or you can get started right away with them. It's as easy as that to get a professional developer added to your team and working on your projects.

            We also offer bulk hour bundles that are valid for 1 year (for the 125 hour bundle) and 18 months (for the
            250 hour bundle) from the date of purchase. These are great for one-off projects or if you want a large bank
            of hours to pull from as-needed.

          <p>
            RipplePop is based in Chicago and our development team is based in the Philippines.&nbsp;We love our
            Filipino team, they are incredibly hard-working and diligent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look for at least 5+ years of custom WordPress development experience along with great English
            skills.&nbsp;Part of our vetting process is making sure our developers have very good English comprehension
            and writing skills to reduce the risk of any miscommunications.

            In short, yes you can use one of our plans to complete a project. Just remember, that our plans are not
            bound to your project scope or deadline. If the project is not going to meet its deadline, we can not be at
            fault. You may just simply need to increase the number of daily hours (upgrade your plan) for your developer
            to better meet a deadline if things are off-track. Our developers will always do their best to help you meet
            your deadlines, but we are in no way bound to your deadlines or project scope.

            Absolutely! Many of our customers have projects ranging from Shopify to marketing to design to app

        <h3 class="mt-16 mb-8 text-4xl text-gray-900 faq-question font-bold">What's the advantage of RipplePop over
          Upwork?</h3>
        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            The main advantage of RipplePop is that you have a company (us) and service offering backing up our
            plans.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If an Upwork freelancer decides to leave town and not answer any emails, you are left with little that you
            can do and even less that you can do legally if they are an international freelancer.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            With us, you get a company that backs the promise. If a dev is not doing a good job for you, you can quickly
            pick a new one on our team to work with and even provide replacement developers if your developer is sick or
            absent. These types of things are what make our service something you might pick over trying to go and find
            the perfect freelancer that you can entrust with the work you have.

      <div class="faq-block" id="what-are-the-different-ways-i-can-scale-my-ripplepop-team">
        <h3 class="mt-16 mb-8 text-4xl text-gray-900 faq-question font-bold">What are the different ways I can scale my
          RipplePop team?</h3>
        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            Scaling your RipplePop team is something we wanted to make simple. There are two ways you can scale:
            Horizontally or Vertically.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Vertically:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong></strong>You have a developer on a 4-hour per day or 2-hour per day plan, and you simply scale up
            their daily hours if they have that availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b style="background-color: initial;">Horizontally:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You already have a developer on another plan for 8, 4, or 2 hours per day.&nbsp;You want to add an
            additional/new developer to the team (maybe with different skills) on their own plan. This allows you to
            grow the depth of your team rather than just scaling up one person's hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you can either scale up your current developer's hours or scale outwards by adding additional developers
            to your team.&nbsp;

          <p>
            Yes! Our developers are yours to use as you need. If you need a developer or team of developers to be
            replying directly to your clients or customers, we can supply the team to do that.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You can make them their own email within your organization for them to use to white-label it even further.
            We try to be flexible here so you can use your developer for your specific use-case.

        <h3 class="mt-16 mb-8 text-4xl text-gray-900 faq-question font-bold">What's the difference between the plans? Do
          hours roll-over?</h3>
        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            When you sign up for RipplePop, you are signing up for 8, 4, or 2 hours of daily help (Monday - Friday). The
            daily hours you receive on your plan do not roll-over if they go unused on a particular day or set of days.
            Since your developer may be helping other customers of ours each day, we can not roll-over hours or bundle
            them in any other way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only difference between the plans is how much daily help you will receive: 8 hours, 4 hours, or 2 hours.
            Everything else about the plans is the same. You can: invite your developer into your tools, ask them for
            help on items small or large, and no restrictions on what you can ask for just as long as it's within the
            developer's skillset and you are ok with the timeline that the developer provides for the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing to keep in mind if you are on a 4-hour or 2-hour per day plan is that your developer services
            other customers before and/or after you. So please respect their time and understand that our developers are
            not bound to giving you overtime work beyond their standard hours. Our support team is also available if you
            have any questions about our plans
            <a href="mailto:mailto:hello@ripplepop.com">hello@ripplepop.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want a more flexible approach to your hours, we offer bulk hour bundles where you get a larger bank
            of hours to pull from as-needed.

        <h3 class="mt-16 mb-8 text-4xl text-gray-900 faq-question font-bold">How do you vet developers?</h3>
        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            We have a very rigorous vetting process to ensure only the best developers make it through to be on our
            team.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Here is what is involved to become a RipplePop Developer:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong></strong>Our Developer Manager is responsible for finding and getting developers to start the
            application process.
          </p>
          <p>
            We run the appropriate background checks, ID checks, and English comprehension tests to ensure we can
            proceed with that applicant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial application is long and it takes around 45 minutes to an hour to complete. It has very specific
            instructions that, if not clearly followed, will result in us immediately disregarding the applicant. We ask
            the developer to record videos as they work and explain their reasoning and decision making as they work.
            This helps us judge their skills in real-world scenarios and get a feel for how they communicate through
            finding solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If their initial application is good, we advance them onto some tests. This includes tests for their
            development skills, CSS skills, and other skills relevant to the customers they plan to serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            If all tests go well, the candidate moves onto the final stage interview. This interview is with our most
            senior level developer. He has been with us for over 4 years now and been a developer for more than 10
            years. He has seen everything under the sun, and we trust him deeply with being able to analyze if a
            developer has what it takes to be a successful developer on our team.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the final interview goes well and the candidate passes, they are in the pool of "ready developers" who
            have been approved and are waiting to be assigned to a customer that matches their skill-set.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the ways we protect our customers is by having a very in-depth and thorough vetting process. This
            helps ensure only the most diligent, honest, knowledgeable, and reliable developers make it through.

        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes!
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's say you've set your developer up for 2-hours of work per day. Today, you have an hour of work (maybe
            less to give them) but you want to make sure you utilize their time. Here are your options:
          </p>
          <p>
            You can have the developer help with other tasks (editing spreadsheets, answering emails, tidying up work,
            admin work, etc) as long as they express they are comfortable working in the associated applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always ask your developer to do more proactive work. Example: "Please review all of my sites and do
            a speed audit. Improve the speed of the poorest performing sites when I do not have other work to give you."
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always lean on your developer for some basic consulting. "What tool is best to accomplish X, Y, and
            Z?" "Can you highlight the best strategy to export and import thousands of custom posts and media?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Your developer's daily hours are yours to utilize. If the amount of dev work is light, you can always get
            creative with asking for help on other items as long as they are comfortable doing so.

            In short, the answer is yes, we absolutely have developers on our team who can handle design as well as

        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            We were often challenged with how we should go about scheduling our developers and how we felt, morally,
            about asking some to work overnight/graveyard shifts due to the larger effect that has on day-to-day life.
            The way we corrected this and allow ourselves to sleep much easier at night is we let our developers work
            out their schedule with you directly and attempt to find the best agreed-upon schedule that will work for
            you both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of our developers often prefer "off-hours" or the graveyard shift, which surprised us at first. We do
            not force our developers to work on schedules they have not indicated as their preference.
          </p>
          <p>
            That way, you get a developer who is happy to be online and working with you during their preferred shift
            schedule. This allows you to do things like a Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts, Slack chat, etc all while they
            are working. This real-time collaboration is a great way to help make sure you always have access to your
            developer during your daily shift schedule.

          <p>
            Yes!
            <br>
            <br>
            We have our own set of tracking and check-in tools to monitor our developers. However, if you want your
            developer to be reporting in a time-tracking tool that your company uses or monitors, you can absolutely do
            that.
            <br>
            <br>
            Simply invite your developer (via their RipplePop or the company email you made for them) into your time
            tracking tool of choice. Then make sure you instruct the developer on how to properly track their time in
            the proper way you are looking for.
            <br>
            <br>
            That's it! You're all set and can now track the hours of your developer.

          </p>
          <p>
            If this is the case for you, you can simply add your developer (via their email) to your password tool and

            control over their account.

            <strong style="background-color: initial;"></strong>This can be more painstaking, but some prefer this
            method. Simply create a new admin user on each site where you want your developer to have access. Make sure
            you set their admin email to their RipplePop email or the email within your org that you created for them.
            That way you still have some level of admin control over them if necessary.

            Most of our customers are people or agencies who are already using a project management tool to track their
            work. Examples of tools we've helped with in the past include&nbsp;Basecamp, Trello, Asana, Jira, Slack,
            Monday, Google Docs, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the major benefits of our plans is that our developers come to you and your tools. So if you are
            using Asana to track to-do items around your site(s), you can simply invite your developer into your Asana
            and they can begin working through those items.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            We do this to allow our customers more flexibility so that they are not restricted to a specific way of

          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not have a Project Management tool in place, let us know and we can always create a private shared

            email if ever needed.

        <h3 class="mt-16 mb-8 text-4xl text-gray-900 faq-question font-bold">Can I pause or freeze my account and retain
          my developer when I return?</h3>
        <div class="text-xl text-gray-900 faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, if you wish to pause your billing and want to return in the future and have us retain the same
            developer who you were assigned, we can do that with a reduced monthly fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reserve your Full-time developer (8-hours per day), the cost is $250/week.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reserve your Part-time developer (4-hours per day), the cost is $125/week.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reserve your Full-time developer (2-hours per day), the cost is $65/week.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are canceling or pausing for just a few days or one-week, oftentimes that is short enough where we
            can reserve your developer without much issue or need for additional charges. However, if you plan on
            pausing for more than a few days, you would need to pay the retainer fee to lock in the same developer and
            time slot when you return again.

            That is the beauty of having a service/business (us!) around!
          </p>
          <p>
            If your developer is ever sick, they will report that to our Customer Champion. Our Customer Champion then
            will contact you to see if there is anything urgent to attend to, or if your developer can make up their
            hours at a later date when they return. We always prefer the hours be made up if possible, but understand
            there are times when you need more urgent help and your developer might be sick or absent.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your developer is unable to make up their hours, or you have something urgent that needs attending to
            before they can return, we can supply you with a coupon code and a list of replacements which will allow you
            to begin working with another developer of ours in order to keep things moving.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your developer is ever sick or misses a day of work, it is not required to get a replacement. If your
            workload is light, you can simply let your developer have the day off if you choose. Or, if you do not want
            a replacement (too many cooks in the kitchen) your developer can always work out a schedule to make up the
            missed hours over the next couple of days.
            <br>
            <br>
            We'll always be here to help in these types of scenarios. If your developer is not reporting in for you
            today and you need something from them, please email us at
            <a href="mailto:mailto:hello@ripplepop.com">hello@ripplepop.com</a> so we can get you a replacement right
            away.

            Yes and no, let us explain.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to change your current developer and work with someone new (for whatever reason), the way you do
            that is you would set your weekly plan to expire (not-renew). Then you would revisit our Developer List we
            shared with you and sign up with the developer you wish to work with instead. We do not allow you to change
            your developer mid-week, so please make sure that if you want to work with someone else on our team, that
            you plan that change accordingly.
