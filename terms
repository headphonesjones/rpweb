      <p class="mt-2 text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-900 underline-a">
        From everyone at RipplePop, thank you for using our services! Our goal has always been to provide you with the
        best work we can. We have grown quite a bit since our early days, and with our inability to know every one of
        our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep things clear for
        everyone.<br /><br />

        When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to RipplePop LLC. When we say
        “contractor” in this document, we are referring to our internal RipplePop team members and contractors. When we
        say “you” in this document we are referring to you, the customer purchasing our Services. <br /><br />

        When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and or maintained by RipplePop LLC. That includes all past
        RipplePop plans which may no longer be actively listed on our website. <br /><br />

        When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That’s true
        for any of our existing and future products and all variations that we add to our Services over time. There may
        be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are
        not waiving that right or position. These terms do contain a limitation for our liability. <br /><br />

        If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. We also reserve the right to terminate your
        account at any time and for any reason. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust
        in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, how we work, and always being open
        to your feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">General Terms</p>
      <ol class="mt-4 ml-8 text-xl list-decimal">

          member.</li>

      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</p>
      <ol class="mt-4 ml-8 text-xl list-decimal">
        <li>For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of the trial when you sign up. After that
          trial period, you need to pay by the completion of the trial to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, you
          will no longer have access to the Service until you make your payment. If you have utilized a trial in the
          past, you will not be eligible for a trial on the same Service offering again in the future.</li>
        <li>For paid Services, you will pay RipplePop at the rates set forth via our active pricing plans on our
          website. Payment is due upon registration for an account and will be billed for on a weekly basis. </li>
        <li>For paid Services that involve a daily hour cap for RipplePop contractors, any unused hours do not roll over
          and can not be utilized at a later date.</li>
        <li>For paid Services that involve a weekly hour cap for RipplePop contractors, you may not request more than 8
          hours of work from your RipplePop contractor in a particular day. Any unused hours, that were purchased in
          bulk at the onset of the Service, do not carry over to the next month of the Service. From the day you
          register for your bulk hours, you have one month to use those hours before they expire. You will schedule the
          hours throughout the month with your RipplePop contractor. </li>
        <li>RipplePop contractor are presumed to be nonexempt from laws requiring premium pay for overtime, holiday
          work, or weekend work. RipplePop will charge the client special rates for premium work time only when a
          RipplePop contractor’s work on assignment to the client, viewed by itself, would legally require premium pay
          and the client has authorized, directed, or allowed the RipplePop contractor to work such premium work time.
          The client's special billing rate for premium hours will be a flat fee of $50 an hour for any overtime,
          holiday work, or weekend work that falls outside of the standard hours of the employment agreement.</li>
        <li>You have read and agree that you understand our <a href="/refunds" class="text-blue-500"
            target="_blank">Refund Policy</a> and how it may relate to your particular product choice.</li>
        <li>All RipplePop contractors are subject to RipplePop's standard USA holidays and days off assigned by
          RipplePop.</li>
        <li>If the client uses the services of any RipplePop contractor as its direct employee, as an independent
          contractor, or through any firm other than RipplePop during an active RipplePop plan or 365 days after
          cancellation of the RipplePop contractor to the client from RipplePop, the client must pay RipplePop a fee in
          the amount of the yearly RipplePop salary for that employee.</li>
        <li>If your payment is late or overdue, we will give you up to 3 business days of additional service while you
          finalize your payment. If your payment does not arrive within 3 business days of it being overdue, your plan
          will be paused and all work will halt until you have made your payment current.</li>
        <li>If you ever wish to change the plan you are on, you can contact us: <a href="mailto:hello@ripplepop.com"
            class="text-blue-500">hello@ripplepop.com</a>. Changes to your plan often involve a pro-ration of charges
          but can be handled on an individual basis depending on the scenario. You are allowed to upgrade/downgrade your
          service once per month with an active plan.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">Non-Compete & Cooperation</p>
      <ul class="mt-4 ml-8 text-xl list-disc">
        <li>RipplePop contractors are assigned to work for you. You can not under any circumstances, sell or staff
          RipplePop's contractors as if they were your own team members.</li>
        <li>RipplePop contractors are restricted from contacting any of your customers regarding any outside work other
          than what was assigned to the RipplePop contractor directly from you. This means, you will be the point of
          contact for the RipplePop contractor. If you want your RipplePop contractor replying directly to your
          customers, you may do that as long as the RipplePop contractor expresses their consent.</li>
        <li>RipplePop shall not solicit or contact any user, account, or related parties without your prior written
          consent. This means, if you are using RipplePop to get work done for clients you manage RipplePop will not and
          can not contact or approach your clients. Your clients are your clients, and we forbid RipplePop contractors
          from making contact with your clients without your explicit written consent to do so. If you want to connect
          us with a friend or someone who may be interested in our services, that is allowed.</li>
        <li>RipplePop can not claim any work that has been completed by the RipplePop contractor as our own. The work we
          complete for you under our Services is under your ownership and RipplePop claims not right to ownership of any
          of the Services rendered. This simply means you will not see us talking with anyone else about the work we
          have done for you, that work is confidential and RipplePop nor its contractors have ownership over the work
          rendered, you do. We may share your testimonial on our site if you permit us to.</li>
        <li>Both parties agree to cooperate fully and to provide assistance to the other part in the instance of an
          investigation and resolution of any complaints, claims, actions, or proceedings that may be brought by or that
          may involve RipplePop or its contractors. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">Extended Employment and Pay Raises</p>
      <ul class="mt-4 ml-8 text-xl list-disc">
        <li>We have a lot of customers who stay with us for months on end, if not longer. If you are with us, and the
          same RipplePop contractor for 6 months or more, you can opt-in to giving your RipplePop contractor a raise. A
          raise equates to a $100/mo fee on top of your existing Service charge. This extra fee goes directly into the
          pocket of your RipplePop contractor and is a great way for you to reward a RipplePop contractor for their
          extended efforts with you. We can always work out a custom raise amount and we will contact you with regards
          to this raise after you have been with us for 6 months or more with the same active Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">Swaps and Changes to Your Team</p>
      <ul class="mt-4 ml-8 text-xl list-disc">
        <li>In order to swap in a new developer and replace your existing one, you must first cancel your plan with your
          existing developer. Then pick the replacement developer you wish to work with from our Developer List and you
          can begin on a new plan with them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-8 text-2xl text-gray-900 graphik-bold">Liability</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-xl">
        We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:<br /><br />

        You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any
        third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary
        damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible
        losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or
        the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from
        any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into
        through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv)
        statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of
        Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive),
        or any other theory of liability.<br /><br />

        In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out,
        that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the
        business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to
        use our Services, thank you for betting on us.<br /><br />

        Neither party will be responsible for failure or delay in the performance of this Agreement if the failure or
        delay is due to labor disputes, strikes, fire, riot, war, terrorism, acts of God, or any other causes beyond the
        control of the nonperforming party.<br /><br />
